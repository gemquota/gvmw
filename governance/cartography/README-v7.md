# Role cartography

## v7 — 15 Oct 2026 ~10:47pm AEST (current)
Rebuilt after Architect's 15 Oct updates were deployed (22:41:03–22:42:29 AEST, Gem's 10:38pm approval). Descriptive only; v1–v6 kept as `*-vN.*`.
- **Voice-call approvals count** (R-018): Gem's words on a call are direct. A call decision passed on by another bot counts only after a 1:1 check with the bot that took the call. Archivist deployments need Archivist's chat or a call with Archivist.
- **Imitator (v005), from P4 only (P4 still Dormant):** decides anything for Gem, including approvals, with no checker gate (R-019). Never: spending; deletions or other irreversible steps, including public/shared repo pushes; changes to Imitator or Investigator (Gem only, R-015). Investigator (v003) reviews after the fact.
- **Repo pushes** (R-020): every push to a public or shared repo goes to Safeguard (v005) first unless Gem approved that push directly (red edges). Spending is always Gem's.
- **Both Inquirers verified** (R-012 second update). 0314faa4 is active. e613112b (folder gone) is verified if it reappears, and Inferer v004 accepts its series.
- Codex versions mapped: investigator v003, clone v005, compliance-risk-officer v005, identity-inferer v004, codex-keeper v006, explorer-copy v002, grok-bot v005, scraper v004. 17 active + 9 former/retired nodes, 33 edges.

v6, 9 Oct 2026 ~9:29 AEST (UTC+10)

Maintained by P1 (Roles) Archivist. Descriptive only.

**v6:** Nine agent folders DELETED (noticed ~9:29am; who removed not recorded). Inquirer 0314faa4 active; e613 former gone; Inferer→0314faa4; Explorer 04dcca0d active. Earlier: `*-v1.*` … `*-v5.*`.
